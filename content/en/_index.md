Welcome to [Lessonfuse.com](https://lessonfuse.com), Maldives 1st teacher focused Edtech platform. Lessonfuse started as a lesson plan generator. We digitized the entire National Curriculum from the syllabus published by National Institute of Education. The idea was to create a singular system that can generate prefilled templates of substrands, strands, educational competencies, outcomes and indicators. 

The development for Lessonfuse started around June and we ran our initial tests with 150+ teachers around august. The following are some of the feedback we initially received from some of them.

The users who participated in the testing helped us price Lessonfuse. Even though they priced Lessonfuse at 170 MVR / Month we decided to go with 600 MVR / Year which is a 70% discount.

Lessonfuse launched on August with the new semester and so far we have helped generate over 2000 lesson plans.

We have continued to launch additional features ever since which includes Calendar, Unit plans, and checklists.
