### Pricing Changes

We reserve the right to change the pricing at any time. Pricing changes will only effect new users. Existing users will be locked into the pricing they signed up for.

As Lessonfuse improves and adds more features, the price can be expected to increase as our costs will increase.

### Refunds

We are unable to issue refunds at this time due to the nature of the product and the speed this service is being developed at. We may offer refunds in the future once we are more established.
