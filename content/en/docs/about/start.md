Lessonfuse simplifies lesson plan creation in line with the National Curriculum Framework, eliminating the hassle of copying and pasting outcomes and indicators. It is the next step in the evolution of tools such as templates and excel sheets used by teachers.

## The structure

Lessonfuse contributors update subjects with the latest National Curriculum Framework changes, enabling free access for them and up-to-date lesson plans for other teachers.

This effort also allows for a publicly accessible digitized version of the National Curriculum Framework and the development of more tools by other developers.

## How it started

It started with excel templates that brought so much ease within the teachers of Maavashu Schools to the extent that they were willing to pay for it.

The manual mode is a direct reflection of those excel templates but expanded into the whole curriculum and served online for all teachers in Maldives.
