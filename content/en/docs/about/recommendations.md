### Office Suite

To open generated lesson plans, we recommend using the latest version of Office 365, which can be purchased for a group of 6 people for as little as 20 MVR per month per person. If paid yearly it is around 16 MVR per month per person.

With 365 you get the latest version of Office and 1TB of OneDrive storage along with a lot of premium features for word, excel, powerpoint and more.

Cracked software may contain viruses. Considering the low cost and the high daily use of the office suite for teachers we believe purchasing Office 365 is a wise choice for teachers.
