Lessonfuse contains several generation modes. Each mode is designed to help teachers in different ways. The Lessonplan generations include:

- Manual Mode
- Assisted Mode
- Smart Mode
- Sen Mode

There are several repeated areas shared by all the modes.

### The grade and subject selection

Users will select a grade first and then a subject. The subject selection will be limited to the subjects available for the selected grade.

### The Substrand selection

Note that we skipped the strand selection. This is because lessonfuse automatically selects the strand based on the selected substrand.

In all subjects you will see a mixed mode as a substrand. This is a special substrand that contains all the outcomes and indicators for the subject. This is for situations like English where the strands are structured different from other subjects.

### The Outcomes and Indicators

After the substrand is selected we will display the set of outcomes and indicators for that substrand. The user can tick the indicators and outcomes. Ticking an indicator will automatically tick the outcome it belongs to. Unticking an outcome will automatically untick all the indicators it belongs to.

### Class duration and week

These fields are text fields which you can enter any value. In AI generation the duration you enter here is sent to the AI. So in theory you can create a lessonplan that spans for 24 hours.

### Button to fill optional fields

This button will fill the optional fields with the default values. The optional fields will include every little bit of information that is in a lesson plan.

We would still recommend using word to edit the rest of the document, however should you wish to edit the complete lesson plan in lessonfuse, you can do so.

### Educational Competencies

The educational competencies section include the educational competencies at first. Once you tick some of them and click Apply, the indicators for the selected educational competencies will be displayed.

You are expected to tick the indicators and proceed to the next step.
