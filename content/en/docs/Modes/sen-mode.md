SEN mode was introduced to support SEN teachers who wanted to use Lessonfuse. It allows the teacher to describe the student and their needs, and replaces outcomes with a text field for the teacher to enter their own. The more details the teacher provides, the better the generation will be.

## Fillable Fields
