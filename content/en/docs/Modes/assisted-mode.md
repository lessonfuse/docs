Assisted mode would require teachers to enter a general idea of focus for their lesson plans. The teachers would also be picking the Educational Competencies and their Indicators, just like manual mode.

The difference is that the AI would try to connect the general idea of focus with the Educational Competencies and their Indicators. If the teacher does not provide a lot of details in the focus section the AI would give more preference to the Outcomes, Educational Competencies and their Indicators over the focus.

Assisted mode is planned to be replaced with a new mode soon.
