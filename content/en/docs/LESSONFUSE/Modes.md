## Lesson Plan Generation Modes

Lessonfuse offers several generation modes designed to assist teachers in creating lesson plans. Each mode serves a different purpose and provides various levels of automation. Here is an overview of the available modes and the common features they share:

1. **Grade and Subject Selection**:
   - Users start by selecting a grade level, followed by a subject. Subject options are limited to those available for the chosen grade.

2. **Sub strand Selection**:
   - Lessonfuse automatically selects the strand based on the chosen sub strand. A "Mixed Mode" sub strand is available, containing all outcomes and indicators for that subject to cater for language subjects

3. **Outcomes and Indicators**:
   - After selecting the sub strand, users are presented with a set of outcomes and indicators for that sub strand.
   - Users can tick indicators and outcomes. Ticking an indicator will automatically tick the associated outcome, and unticking an outcome will untick its related indicators.

4. **Class Duration and Week**:
   - Text fields allow users to enter the desired class duration and week for the lesson plan.
   - The entered duration is sent to the AI, as entered.

5. **Button to Fill Optional Fields**:
   - This button populates optional fields with default values, ensuring comprehensive lesson plan information.

6. **Educational Competencies**:
   - The educational competencies section initially displays educational competencies.
   - After selecting competencies and clicking "Apply," indicators related to the chosen competencies are displayed.
   - Users are expected to tick the relevant indicators.

### Assisted Mode (Not recommended as of now)
- Assisted mode is being discontinued


### Manual Mode
- Manual Mode is for teachers who prefer not to use AI generation.
- Teachers can instantly download a pre-filled template with all outcomes and indicators.

### SEN Mode (Special Educational Needs)
- SEN mode is designed to support teachers working with students who have special educational needs.
- Teachers describe the student's special needs in detail to enhance the generation.
- It includes fields for ICP (Individualized Curriculum Plan) goals, outcomes (entered by the teacher), class duration, strand (visible in Mixed mode), sub strand (visible in Mixed mode), and week.

### Smart Mode
- Smart mode requires teachers to input outcomes and indicators only.
- The AI handles the rest of the lesson plan generation.
- While some smart mode-generated lesson plans may be suitable as-is, most serve as starting points for teachers to edit and customize.
