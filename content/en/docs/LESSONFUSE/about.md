## It All Began with Excel

Our journey started with Excel templates that greatly simplified the lives of teachers at Maavashu Schools. These templates were so effective that teachers were willing to pay for them. The manual mode in Lessonfuse is a direct reflection of the convenience these Excel templates provided. We have expanded this concept to encompass the entire curriculum, now available online for all teachers in the Maldives.

Lessonfuse is committed to ushering in a new era of efficient and user-friendly teaching tools. Thank you for joining us on this transformative journey!

## Digitization: Bridging the Gap

Traditionally, the curriculum has been presented in a PDF format, which is ideal for printing and sharing but less than optimal for building innovative educational tools. At Lessonfuse, we are on a mission to revolutionize this process by digitizing the curriculum and offering it in a structured format. This digitized version will serve as a valuable resource for developers, enabling them to create powerful tools that enhance the teaching and learning experience.

## Streamlining Lesson Planning

Lessonfuse is designed to simplify the creation of lesson plans, aligning seamlessly with the National Curriculum Framework. Our platform eliminates the tedious task of copying and pasting outcomes and indicators, representing the next evolutionary step beyond traditional templates and Excel sheets used by teachers.

### The Structure: Empowering Contributors

Lessonfuse thrives on the contributions of educators who update subjects in accordance with the latest National Curriculum Framework changes. This not only grants them free access to the platform but also ensures that fellow teachers have access to up-to-date lesson plans. This collective effort paves the way for a publicly accessible, digitized version of the National Curriculum Framework, opening doors for additional innovative tools created by developers.

# Pricing Options

At Lessonfuse, we understand the importance of affordability in delivering valuable educational services. We are pleased to offer flexible pricing options that cater to the diverse needs of our teacher community.

## Standard Pricing

Lessonfuse provides a yearly subscription for just 600 MVR.

### Discounted Rates

We recognize and appreciate the contributions of teachers who actively engage with the Lessonfuse project. As such, we extend various discounts to eligible groups within our community:

- **Contributors**: We grant contributors free access to the platform

- **Dhivehi Medium Teachers**: Dhivehi medium teachers are entitled to a substantial 50% discount, making their annual subscription just 300 MVR.

- **New Users**: New users are offered Lessonfuse at the standard annual subscription rate of 600 MVR. 1 day trials are available on request.

## Pricing Adjustments

To ensure flexibility and adaptability, Lessonfuse reserves the right to adjust pricing as necessary. However, rest assured that these adjustments will only impact new users, allowing existing users to maintain their locked-in pricing.

As Lessonfuse continues to evolve and introduce new features, some price adjustments may occur in line with increased operational costs. We are committed to delivering an exceptional lesson planning experience and will always strive to balance cost-effectiveness with value.

## Refund Policy

At this juncture, Lessonfuse is unable to issue refunds due to the rapid development pace of our service. However, as we establish ourselves further, we may explore refund options to better accommodate our users' needs.

Your support and participation in Lessonfuse are greatly appreciated. We are committed to providing an affordable and enriching educational platform, and your feedback and engagement are invaluable in shaping our journey.

Thank you for choosing Lessonfuse as your educational partner!
