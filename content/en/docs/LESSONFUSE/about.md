## Streamlining Lesson Planning

Lessonfuse is designed to simplify the creation of lesson plans, aligning seamlessly with the National Curriculum Framework. Our platform eliminates the tedious task of copying and pasting outcomes and indicators, representing the next evolutionary step beyond traditional templates and Excel sheets used and shared around by teachers.

### The Structure: Empowering Contributors

Lessonfuse is here, thanks to the efforts of our contributors. Contributors are responsible for updating the curriculum when changes happen to any subjects. 

This grants them free access to the platform and ensures that all teachers can make lesson plans as per the curriculum.

This collective effort paves the way for a publicly accessible, digitized version of the National Curriculum Framework, opening doors for additional innovative tools created by developers specifically for the Maldivian curriculum.

# Pricing Options

We understand the importance of affordability in delivering valuable educational services. We are pleased to offer flexible pricing options that cater to the diverse needs of our teacher community.

## Standard Pricing

Lessonfuse provides a yearly subscription for just 600 MVR.

### Discounted Rates

We recognize and appreciate the contributions of teachers who actively engage with the Lessonfuse project. As such, we extend various discounts to eligible groups within our community:

- **Contributors**: We grant contributors free access to the platform

- **Dhivehi Medium Teachers**: Dhivehi medium teachers are entitled to a substantial 50% discount, making their annual subscription just 300 MVR.

- **New Users**: New users are offered Lessonfuse at the standard annual subscription rate of 600 MVR. 1 day trials are available on request.


## Pricing Adjustments

To ensure flexibility and adaptability, Lessonfuse reserves the right to adjust pricing as necessary. However, rest assured that these adjustments will only impact new users, allowing existing users to maintain their locked-in pricing.

As Lessonfuse continues to evolve and introduce new features, some price adjustments may occur in line with increased operational costs. We are committed to delivering an exceptional lesson planning experience and will always strive to balance cost-effectiveness with value.

## Refund Policy

At this time, Lessonfuse is unable to issue refunds due to the rapid development pace of our service. However, as we establish ourselves further, we may explore refund options to better accommodate our users' needs.


## Progress in Digitization

Lessonfuse is here today thanks to the relentless efforts of our contributors. They digitized the National Curriculum Framework in record time. We're thrilled to share our ongoing journey with you through regularly updated overviews.

## Roadmap
