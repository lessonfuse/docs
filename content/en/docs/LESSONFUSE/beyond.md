## Calendar

In the past, storing calendars in PDFs and Word documents served its purpose well, especially when smartphones were not as common. However, with the prevalence of smartphones among everyone, it's time to embrace a more efficient approach.

Lessonfuse is proud to introduce an iCal version of the academic calendar, mirroring the Ministry of Education's official calendar. This iCal version allows you to seamlessly import it into popular calendar applications like Google Calendar, whether you use Apple or Android devices.

By integrating the academic calendar into your phone's calendar app, you transform events into easily accessible entries. Say goodbye to searching for PDFs and zooming in to view details. Most calendar apps will also provide convenient notifications before events, ensuring you never miss an important date.

This calendar is publicly available for everyone to use at [lessonfuse.com/calendar](https://lessonfuse.com/calendar).

## Checklists

Originally scheduled for a late September release, we are thrilled to unveil our Checklists feature ahead of schedule, as it's now ready for you to use. The Checklists interface boasts a new design, streamlining the checklist creation process on a single screen. This intuitive design will later be applied to Unit Plans and Lesson Plans as well.

To get started, simply select a grade and subject, then click "Generate." Currently, checklists are sent directly to your email, with future plans to introduce a history feature and more.

### Unlocking Checklists

We've added a password lock to the checklists to make them more user-friendly and to prevent accidental modifications. To unlock them, use the password: `lessonfuse`.

## Unit Plans

Unit Plans are now stable and come in two versions: "New" and "Old."

The "Old" system is still recommended for English and Dhivehi subjects, where strands function slightly differently compared to other subjects. We plan to enhance this old system to better accommodate Language subjects.

The "New" system is designed around Excel, with each indicator on a separate row. To group multiple items into one lesson, teachers are expected to combine the cells in the "Week" column, indicating that they belong to the same week.

These enhancements and features are part of Lessonfuse's ongoing commitment to providing teachers with valuable tools and resources to streamline their teaching processes.
