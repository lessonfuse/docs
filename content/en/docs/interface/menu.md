The menu on top has 3 main links. Home, History and Logout.

Home takes you back to the [main interface]({{< ref "/main_interface.md" >}} "main interface").

[History](../history/) will show every lesson plan you have generated and their status and how long ago they were generated.

Logout will log you out of the application.
