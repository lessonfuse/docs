Storing calender in PDFs and word documents were great when smartphones were not as common.

Now that smartphones are owned by everyone, it is time to move to a better way of doing things.

Lessonfuse will be maintaining an iCal version of the same academic calender that is available on the Ministry of Education website.

This calender enables you to import it to google calender or any other mainstream calender app. This works on apple and android devices.

Essentially this means the academic calender will become events on the calender application on your phone. This is way better than finding the pdf and zooming in.

Most calender apps will also give you a notification before the event making this a better way to keep track of the academic calender events.

This calender is available publicly for everyone to use from [lessonfuse.com/calender](https://lessonfuse.com/calender).
