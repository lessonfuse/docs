Checklists were something we planned to release in late september however, we decided to release it early as it was ready.

The checklists interface follows a new design, where everything is completed from one screen. This design will be later applied to the unitplans and lessonplans as well.

The way to use it is to simply select a grade and a subject and click generate.

At this time checklists are only sent to your email and there is no history as well. We will be adding these features in the future.

## The checklists are locked

We locked the checklists to make it easier for the teachers to use. and to not make mistakes.

To unlock the password is `lessonfuse`
