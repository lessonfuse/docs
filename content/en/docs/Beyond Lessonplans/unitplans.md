Unitplans are now stable. There are two versions, labeled as New and Old.

The old system is still recommended for English and Dhivehi where strands work a little different compared to other subjects. This old system will be improved to cater Language subjects.

The new system works based on excel instead of word. By design each indicator is on a seperate row. For allocating multiple items into one lesson teachers are expected to combine the cells on the week column to indicate they belong to one week.
